# Python for Data Science - Module 2

This repository contains the solutions to the **Python for Data Science – Module 2** assignment as part of my Data Science learning journey. The project involves working with three datasets (`SalesData.xlsx`, `imdb.csv`, and `diamonds.csv`) and answering various questions using Python and the `pandas` library.

## Project Overview

The assignment covers practical exercises that help build skills in:

 Reading and processing Excel and CSV files  
 Data manipulation using `pandas`  
 Grouping, aggregation, filtering, and sorting data  
 Handling missing values and duplicate rows  
 Working with dates and calculating differences  
 Creating new columns based on conditions  

The project is structured into three sections based on the datasets used:

1- **Sales Dataset**  
   Perform data aggregation, calculate differences in dates, and compute percentage sales.

2- **IMDb Dataset**  
   Analyze movie data to find shortest and longest duration movies, sort by release date and rating, and filter by duration.

3- **Diamonds Dataset**  
   Handle missing data, remove duplicates, filter numeric columns, compute volumes based on conditions, and impute missing prices.

##  Datasets

1- **SalesData.xlsx** – Contains sales information like item sold, sales amount, regions, managers, and order dates.  
2- **imdb.csv** – Contains information related to movies and series such as title, rating, duration, genre, and release year.  
3- **diamonds.csv** – Contains details about diamonds including carat, cut, depth, and price.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**  
- **pandas** – For data manipulation and analysis  
- **datetime** – For handling dates and calculating differences  
- **Jupyter Notebook or VS Code** – Development environment  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and repository hosting
